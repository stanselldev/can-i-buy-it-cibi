# Can I Buy It (CIBI)

This is a budget application that allows you to view your finances from a calendar perspective and have a rolling balance health indicator.  What that means is, per your set bills and one time expenses, CIBI will calculate far into the future to tell you if and when you might OVERDRAFT or be close to overdrafting, thus the name.  You can input a bill and see if later down the road, thats going to cause you to be low on funds or not.  Gives you a better idea of what your finances look like in the future.

I am currently learning GraphQL + Prisma + Apollo and will be building the back end with it. I still need to finish up the UI and make some changes, but the overall concept is there.

I also plan on implementing the new Context features from React instead of using Redux.  Not entirely sure I will need Redux for this just yet.  TBD.
