1. Need to hook up authentication and a database
  - need login and signup pages
  - need logout button

2. Need to hook up starting balance and display running balance on each days 
  - Maybe simple color coding or a number in small letter
  - This needs to be stored in a separate context called SETTINGS which will also house any other settings we build in the future
  - We need to record the following:
    - Date that Starting Balance was set
    - Amount

3a. Need to limit expenses from being added to previous months and skewing data; they should only show going forward for NON-ONE-TIME Expenses
3b. Need to handle day issue with February with 28 days and also for leap years

4. Expenses page is where users can see a list of their monthly expenses and also add to them
  - this will be the second place they can add their expenses

5. Dashboard
  - This screen will give the user a top-down view a lot of different perspectives regarding their finances
    - 1. Show how many months worth of savings they have (savings / total monthly bills)

6. I think I would like to tie the YNAB api to this to where the expenses that come in from the users bank account can easily feed through and onto the days they were charged on. 
  - Can add category tags to them to correspond to the categories that they relate to on YNAB
  - Yodlee.com appears to be able to access bank apis like YNAB, might look into this if app gets popular
