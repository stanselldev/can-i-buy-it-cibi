1. Need to hook up authentication and a database
  - need login and signup pages
  - need logout button

2. Need to LIFT the expenses up from the expense container so we can use that data to determine the cell colour
- May need to create an object or array that houses the cell data that gets rendered. This way we can have that data readily available at all times ANYWHERE
- Right now we are simply pulling data from JSON on the expenseContainer and sending it to the Modal.  It is not accesible to the Calendar at this moment

3. Need to limit expenses from being added to previous months and skewing data; they should only show going forward for NON-ONE-TIME expenses

4. Expenses page is where users can see a list of their monthly expenses and also add to them
  - this will be the second place they can add their expenses

5. Dashboard
  - This screen will give the user a top-down view a lot of different perspectives regarding their finances
    - 1. Show how many months worth of savings they have (savings / total monthly bills)

6. I think I would like to tie the YNAB api to this to where the expenses that come in from the users bank account can easily feed through and onto the days they were charged on. 
  - Can add category tags to them to correspond to the categories that they relate to on YNAB
  - Yodlee.com appears to be able to access bank apis like YNAB, might look into this if app gets popular


1. Rebuild with Next.js 
  - <Link /> is the only thing we will likely need to change in current React code
2. Build Database
3. Build Authentication
4. Restructure code to better handle expenses from the page launch
  - Need to be able to access it anywhere from app since it is needed for almost all pages of application
5. Work out bugs like previous month's having expenses entered on a month AFTER
  - Ex. Enter expense on July 1, 2019, and that expense shows up for May 1, 2019 if its recurring, we dont want that to happen
6. Finish design
  - Status color on day of month (toggle-able)
  - Show current total somewhere
  - Consider hooking up YNAB API
  - Dashboard page with different widgets, graphs, charts, etc. (later)
